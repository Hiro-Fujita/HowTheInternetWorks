                The story is about how in a short span of time since the birth of the Internet, a new and unique way of finding information/search revolutionized the Web. Before 1995, search engines relied on databases of textual keywords to find relevant results. Whenever a user entered a search term, search engines such as AltaVista and Lycos would compare the search term to their databases of terms. The pages that had text most similar to the search term were considered to be more relevant and were featured higher in the list of search results. This did not always prove to provide beneficial results and improved search engines i.e. Yahoo and Google were discovered in 1994 and 1998 respectively.

                Yahoo was the pioneer search engine in which they popularized it and held the majority of the market for the time being. For the first time, Yahoo has shown that it was possible to make money on the web. This started the “web boom.” Excite was their rival company and both of them started by Stanford geeks. With other competitors, the market was distributed amongst them all.

                By 1997, the internet was exploding, the hype surrounding it had people flocking towards it. However, one issue all of the companies faced was that their search engine was poorly optimized. The companies focused on other aspects of their search engines that rack in revenue and the core value was, for a lack of better words, laid off.

            </p>
            <p>
                Another Stanford alumni company was founded in 1998. Google. The Google search engine was built on the premise of finding the most relevant links and to develop an algorithm to recommend the best link possible. “In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A for page B. Google assesses a page’s importance by the votes it receives.” This was revolutionary because here it was, a search engine that actually cared about its search features. As a matter of fact, it was so popular, the founders had to move off campus because of the traffic Google had on the Stanford servers.

            </p>
            <p>
                In 2004, Google went public with over 3 billion in revenue and allowed the public to be shareholders. Over the years, Google overtook Yahoo and Bing, and the other web searching engines. Today, Google provides the greatest user experience on the world wide web and has been dominating the market in current times. Google remains a highly-tuned capitalist machine, one that continues to thrive on the marriage of search and advertising that the company has perfected. The advancement of technology and advertisement goes hand to hand. But that’s not it, Google sticks its fingers in anything they can reach: emails, library, books, docs, calendar, YouTube, etc.
