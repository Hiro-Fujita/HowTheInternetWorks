                The internet was the work of dozens of pioneering scientists, programmers, and engineers who each developed new features and technologies that all contributed to what we know today. Nikola Tesla actually toyed with the idea of a “world wireless system” in the early 1900s.

                The first computers were enormously large and weren’t created with the intention of communicating. It was as large as a room or even bigger. A city or campus would be lucky to have one. However, the frightening display of Soviet scientific superiority during the Cold War spurred the U.S. into teamwork. To catch up, President Eisenhower created the Bureau at the Defense Department called ARPA (a.k.a. Advanced Research Projects Agency). However, computer research was halted due to the focus on the space program and NASA. At this point, the computer communication was in the embryonic stage.

                At MIT a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock began applying the queuing theory to data transmission. Queuing theory is a fantastic tool for evaluating computer and communication systems. Kleinrock implemented two techniques to demonstrate and determine the speed of the network: demand access and distributed control. In demand access, effective resource sharing is controlled by not receiving information until you need it. In distributed control, no one should control the entire network, rather everyone should share that control. It should decide the routing procedure, how much traffic is allowed in, where it’s going, when to do the reassembly, and when to do all of the functions in a distributed fashion.

                Now to the issue of telecommunications. If telephone circuits were not connected, the call would be lost. That weakness became a matter of national attention to the U.S. military as they feared a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. A blast would destroy the telephone circuits, resulting in a loss of communication to the military and the country itself. It would be so damaged, they would not be able to launch a counter-attack. In order to prevent this, Americans need an impenetrable communications network. To find a way to prevent this, Paul Baran was hired to find a solution. He came up with the notion of what he and his team called the hot-potato-routing. In which it’s modeled after an experiment of mice in a maze trying to find their way. This meant message transiting a network got to where it was going, even if part of the network was destroyed. The information would flow through the network by chopping up the message into packets in which they are launched through the network. And there is no dedicated path to reach the goal, meaning even if a part of the network was destroyed, it would still find a way to the recipient.

                The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network. On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message. The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks.

                From there, researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. The web helped popularize the Internet among the public and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis.
